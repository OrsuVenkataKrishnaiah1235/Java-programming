                     Here is a brief cheat sheet for Java:

1.Variables: declared with a type (e.g. int, float, double, char, etc.) and must be initialized before use.
2.Basic data types: int, double, float, char, boolean.
3.Arrays: declared with a type and size, e.g. int[] arr = new int[10].
4.Loops: for, while, do-while.
5.Conditional statements: if-else, switch.
6.Classes: blueprint for objects, with variables (fields) and methods (functions).
7.Objects: instances of a class, created with the new keyword.
8.Constructors: special methods called when an object is created, used to initialize fields.
9.Inheritance: allows classes to inherit fields and methods from a parent class.
10.Polymorphism: ability of objects to take on multiple forms, e.g. a parent class reference can refer to a child class object.
